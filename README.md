# IcePhenologyModels
This repository includes code associated with "Projecting climate change impacts
on ice phenology across midwestern and northeastern United States lakes".

- **Notebooks**: directory contains two Jupyter notebooks connected to building and aggregating daily meteorological time series
- **scripts**: contains a Python script that calculates ice phenology based on a random forest model trained on lakes across the midwestern and northeastern United States 
- **Models**: Random forest ice phenology models (ice-on and ice-off).
- **Data**: List of weather stations used to build each lake's continuous daily meteorological record.
